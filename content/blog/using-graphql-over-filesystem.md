## The Power of Git and the filesystem

Using the filesystem for website content has been a mainstay of the web development ecosystem for years. Not needing to deal with databases and being able to ship your entire website in one fell swoop and roll anything back with thanks to Git has made this a popular and efficient way to get things done.

On the other hand, the open nature of using files for content can lead to headaches. Content Management Systems (CMS) have always provided confidence in another way - the knowledge that your content's shape won't change out from underneath you. The scary (and powerful) thing about using the filesystem is that there's no layer between you and the raw data. It's a trade-off that has a lot of valid use-cases, and a lot of potential foot-guns.

### The shape of your content

Let's say you have a blog. Your typical blog post has a `title`, some information about the `author`, a `published` flag to indicate if it's ready to be shown on your website, and of course, a `body`. You decide to store it in a `markdown` file:

```md
---
title: Vote For Pedro
published: true
author:
  name: Napolean
  role: Llama Caretaker
---

You should really vote for Pedro
```

From your website you pull down all of the files which are `published` and pass them through your rendering templates. You instruct Napolean to pass in `published: false` when he's working on a new blog post. So he does:

```md
---
title: Tater Tots
published: 'false'
author:
  name: Napolean
  role: Llama Caretaker
---

Gimme some of your 'tots
```

Can you spot the issue? `"false"` is a string. Your logic will likely be checking for a "truthy" value on the `published` key. `"false"` will pass that test, meaning you've just published this post by accident!

You're starting to think perhaps using a CMS would have been a safer bet. Most CMSs require you to be explicit about the shape of your content to avoid these issues. But then you think again - "Nah, this site is so simple. CMSs are clunky and hard to set up." So you build-in some type checks to make sure this kind of mistake doesn't happen again, and with a revived sense of confidence you're ready to add new features...

### Relationships: it's complicated

Let's get back to the example. Your site is growing. and Napolean is writing more and more blog posts. Aside from that publishing mistake things are pretty good! A few months go by and Napolean is crushing it with the blog posts. Your boss decides it's time for him to be promoted. You'll need to make this new role is reflected on all of his blog posts. Unfortunately the only way to do this right now is to go through them one-by-one to make the change. Wouldn't it be great if you could update that value in one place and have it populate for every blog Napolean has written?

It's certainly possible with the filesystem, so you build a separate file entirely that houses Napolean's information. Now a blog post looks like this (notice how `author` is pointing to the location of Napolean's file):

```md
---
title: Vote For Pedro
published: true
author: /path/to/authors/napolean.md
---

You should really vote for Pedro
```

And in `/path/to/authors/napolean.md` we have Napolean with his new role:

```md
---
name: Napolean
role: Interpretive Dancer
---
```

Future updates to the author only need to happen in one place, but with this change we now have a new problem. When you go to render the webpage, you'll need to fetch the "Vote for Pedro" blog post, and then you'll need to grab the path to the author from _that_ data and fetch the author's information. You removed tedious work from the editing experience, but added complexity to the developer experience. Still, it seems like a worthwhile tradeoff, things are working and your site is easier to for editors to maintain. You take a well-deserved break.

While you were out, someone came along and deleted the `/path/to/authors/napolean.md` file, they were working on a separate part of the app and didn't know that it was being refenced in the `blog post` section. So when it came time to render the blog post section, we looked up that `author` and attempted to fetch that data... oops, our site broke. Luckily for us, we're using Git so those changes can be reverted - 1-point to the filesystem.

But wouldn't it have been nice if there was something in place to tell us that we had just broken all of Napolean's blog posts by deleting that one file? Perhaps that whole "relational database" idea wasn't too bad, after all.

## The Tina Content API

Today we're introducing a tool which marries the power of a headless CMS with the convenience and portability of file-based content. The Tina Content API is a GraphQL-based server which sources content from your local filesystem. It'll also soon be available via our Tina Cloud API, which connects to your Github repository to offer an identical cloud-based service. [Sign up](https://tina.io/early-access/) for early access.

### How does it work?

The problems mentioned above can be solved by telling the Tina Content API a little bit about the shape of your content:

```ts
// in `.tina/schema.ts`
import { defineSchema } from 'tina-graphql-gateway-cli'

defineSchema({
  collections: [
    {
      label: 'Blog Posts',
      name: 'posts',
      path: 'content/posts', // where to store the 'posts' documents
      templates: [
        {
          label: 'Simple Blog Post Template',
          name: 'simple_post',
          fields: [
            {
              type: 'text',
              label: 'Title',
              name: 'title',
            },
            {
              type: 'boolean', // This is a boolean field
              label: 'Published',
              name: 'Published',
            },
            {
              type: 'reference',
              label: 'Author',
              name: 'author',
              collection: 'authors', // a "reference" to a document from the "authors" collection
            },
            {
              type: 'textarea',
              label: 'Body',
              name: 'body',
            },
          ],
        },
      ],
    },
    {
      label: 'Authors',
      name: 'authors',
      path: 'content/authors', // where to store the 'authors' documents
      templates: [
        {
          label: 'Author Template',
          name: 'author',
          fields: [
            {
              label: 'Name',
              type: 'text',
              name: 'name',
            },
            {
              label: 'Role',
              type: 'text',
              name: 'role',
            },
          ],
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
})
```

This explicit step is key to our understanding of your content structure as a whole. So now when you query through GraphQL, you're guaranteed to get the shape you'd expect. And resolving content across multiple documents is trivial:

```graphql
query BlogPost($relativePath: String!) {
  getPostsDocument(relativePath: $relativePath) {
    data {
      ... on BlogPost_Doc_Data {
        title
        published
        author {
          data {
            ... on Author_Doc_Data {
              name
              role
            }
          }
        }
        body
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## FAQ

### What frameworks are supported?

For now we're sticking to some heavy constraints, we only recommend using this API for Next.js projects which are built statically with `getStaticProps`.

While we'll support a full "headless CMS" in the near future, we're still optimizing our cloud-based service - so until then we're only supporting requests which are authenticated via OAuth, this means you can still edit content from your hosted website, but serving it to unauthenticated routes can only be done by rebuilding your site.

### GraphQL for the Filesystem? How is this different from Gatsby's Filesystem plugin?

With Gatsby you query the filesystem through GraphQL, this gives you some pretty powerful features but it doesn't have the same concept of definining a schema. In reality this is much closer to our solution with [Forestry CMS](https://forstry.io), it's just as if we'd made a headless CMS on top of it.

## How does this relate to the Tina ecosystem?

A nice side-effect of knowing all about your content schema is that we know exactly how it should be mutated as well. So while the topic of this post was more about the GraphQL API itself, we fully support autogenerated Tina forms which can be edited locally or via the Tina Cloud API.

> Tina Cloud is currently open to a limited set of Next.js projects, [sign up](https://tina.io/early-access/) for early access to get into the private beta.

## Roadmap

**Pagination and Filtering** - Currently the API has some limitations with regard to supporting the full API we'd like to provide. Specifically, we're working on a rich filtering and pagination API, so until that's finished the API features a very limited "list" query.

**Reverse** **Relationships -** In the near future it'll be possible to query a document _through_ it's dependency. So if a `post` belongs to an `author` - you will soon be able to query all of the `author`'s `posts`.

**Performance** - If you consume the GraphQL API from Tina Cloud, you may notice it's a little slow. We're working on supporting a git-based database solution which will performantly let you bounce between branches and treat it the same as you would locally. To that end, we recommend only consuming the Content API in Tina's edit mode.

**Primive types** - Right now the `defineSchema` function supports various types which are loosely based on [TinaCMS fields](https://tina.io/docs/plugins/fields/) - we have plans to provide a smaller, but more expresive, API which will be more composable. Please chime in to the [RFC](https://github.com/tinacms/rfcs/pull/18) for any input!
